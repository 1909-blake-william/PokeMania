### General Overview
PokeMania is a web service allowing users to register an account and begin collecting pokemon. Users pick one starter and can catch up to 10 random pokemon a day. Users can manage their teams by placing pokemon in and out of their storage box. Users can have a team of up to 6 pokemon at a given time.

Users can challenge other users to battle. Their teams will be pitted against each other and a chance at glory is the reward of putting together a strong team. Users can also trade pokemon amongst each other.

If they user wishes to undergo the ultimate test for their team, they can challenge the 8 gyms to earn a badge from each. Once the user has earned all 8, they can challenge the elite 4: the strongest challenge to defeat.
